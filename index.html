<h1>Faith Masiello</h1>

<p>My name is Faith and I am a 21 year old senior in the VCD program at EWU. My goal is to graduate in the spring of 2017, and I hope everything works out the way it should! I love nature photography, and I am a part of many fandoms. I can be nerdy at times and that's okay. I'm also shy and introverted, which I'm learning to embrace. I also love to read, write, and listen to music. I collect shot glasses and I think I have over 100 by now. I'm a huge Netflix binge watcher. I hope to use my photography skills to do freelance nature shots, or sell my own photos, either as single prints or in calendar format.</p>
<h3>Favorite Book</h3>
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Eat-Pray-Love-Everything-Indonesia/dp/0143038419/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1475858603&sr=8-1&keywords=eat+pray+love">

<p>Although I saw the movie before reading the book, my favorite book would have to be Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert. Following a divorce and a crushing depression, Gilbert set out to examine three different aspects of her nature, set against the backdrop of three different cultures: pleasure in Italy, devotion in India, and on the Indonesian island of Bali, a balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. It's my favorite book because it tells the story of a woman who took her life back and made it her own. It's funny, inspiring, and I'd reccomend it to anyone.</p>
